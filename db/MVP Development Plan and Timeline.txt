	🔍 Overview
This document outlines the backend structure, badge logic, and UI integration points for implementing Know[ledge]'s gamified badge system. The primary badge track is called the Illumination Path, which reflects a user’s progression through uncovering erased stories and completing topic arcs. Additional badge paths include games, reflections, identity-based exploration, and community engagement.

🔦 Illumination Path - Main Progression Badges
Retention Requirement: To maintain your current Illumination Path badge status, users must either complete at least one qualifying task — such as completing a story, finishing an arc, or passing a milestone quiz — per week or continue leveling up. If no qualifying activity occurs within a 7-day period, the badge reverts to the previous tier until re-earned.


This is the linear badge track based on story and arc completion, reflecting a user's growth as a truth-seeker and knowledge keeper.

	You're starting to light the darkness with knowledge
	3
	Torchbearer

	4

	You shine so others can see. Your knowledge guides generations
	6

	You've connected erased histories across communities

🎮 Game Badge Progression (Early Design)[a]
Retention Requirement: To maintain progress in the Game Badge Path, users must complete at least one game per week or continue leveling up. If no game is played within a 7-day period, their current Game Badge status will be paused (badge dims or locks until reactivation).
Level
	Badge
	Criteria
	1
	Uncover
	Play 1 game of any type
	2
	Seeker
	Play 3 different game types
	3
	Revealer
	Score 80%+ on 3 games
	4
	Historian
	Play 10 total games
	5
	Archivist
	Complete all games in a challenge set (weekly/monthly)
	Games should include metadata (game_type) to support filtering and badge triggers.
Additionally, seasonal or rotating Challenge Sets may offer limited-time bonus badges tied to Game Mastery or speed runs (e.g., complete 5 games during Black History Month Challenge).
